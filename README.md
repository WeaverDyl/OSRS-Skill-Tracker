# OSRS Skill Tracker

A combination of the [OSRS-Clan-Hiscore-Ranker](https://github.com/WeaverDyl/OSRS-Clan-Hiscore-Ranker) and the [OSRS-Hiscore-Grabber](https://github.com/WeaverDyl/OSRS-Hiscore-Grabber) that I wrote around a year ago. 

This is a clan toolkit for [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/). It combines a hiscore system as well as a skill event system.

### Hiscore System
The hiscore system is fairly simple. Many clans keep hiscores of their top members, but it can get tedious having to look each member up to get the data. With this program, you can simply keep a text file containing the names of all the members, load the file into the program, and calculate the relative ranks of every member of the clan for every skill in the game (including, of course, the overall level). Note that you aren't required to load a file, but can also opt to type in, or even paste a list of player names and calculate the results that way.
